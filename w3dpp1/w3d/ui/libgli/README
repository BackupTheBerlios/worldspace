General
-------

To stop any misunderstandings: I did NOT write the essential parts of this
library. Roman Podobedov did (http://romka.demonews.com).
But the library didn't seem to be maintained anymore and he didn't respond
to my E-Mails, so I forke libgli off gli and maintain it now.
Why did I do so?
Because I think it would be a waste to let this fine piece of code go to
waste :)
